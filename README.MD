# TrueStorageCheck ðŸ’¾

TrueStorageCheck is an open-source software tool designed to verify the authenticity and advertised capacity of various storage media. It works with a wide range of devices, from SD cards, internal hard drives, to USB and memory sticks.

TrueStorageCheck works similarly to H2testw with some key improvements - it is adapted for testing multiple devices simultaneously and provides faster results by terminating the test the moment a validation error occurs. It's lightweight and simple to use, making it an essential tool for anyone in need of reliable storage verification. I originally wrote this for fun after being tasked with testing quite a few potentially fake USB sticks, the project kept growing during last years and is a reliable tool so so I'm making it open-source.

## Features

- Support for various storage media: SD cards, internal hard drives, USB sticks, memory sticks, etc..
- Multi-device testing: Capable of verifying multiple storage devices simultaneously
- Fast error detection: The test stops as soon as a validation error is detected
- Lightweight and portable (no installation required)
- Simple to use: Clear and intuitive user interface (I hope, suggestions are always welcome)
- Multilanguage (feel free to add your own)

## TODO

- Log files
- Multi-threaded data generation
- Check if drive is empty before testing (GUI)
- CLI

## How to Use

## GUI

### Arguments

You can pass several arguments when starting up (case insensitive):
